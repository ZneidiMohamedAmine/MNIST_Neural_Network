 # MNIST Digit Recognition from Scratch ðŸ§ ðŸ”¢
Welcome to my first neural network project! Here, I started from the ground up, creating a simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. This project has been quite a journey, from understanding the basics without any libraries to eventually diving into PyTorch.

## Project Overview
### My Learning Process
I began with the basics, building a simple neural network completely from scratch to truly understand how things work behind the scenes. I experimented with random inputs, outputs, and targets to get a feel for how data flows through a neural network. It was fascinating to see it in action!

Once I got comfortable, I decided to tackle a real challenge: using the MNIST dataset as input and having the network classify each digit (0-9) as output. Modifying my initial network to handle this new task came with its own set of hurdles, and since I was mostly on my own, there were a lot of trial and error moments.

### Discovering PyTorch
Eventually, I decided to give PyTorch a try. PyTorch made many processes a lot smoother and easier to implement, which was a big help as I continued to refine the network. This code is the final result of my first MNIST neural network project using PyTorch.

### What's Next?
This project has been an incredible learning experience, and itâ€™s just the start! Iâ€™m currently working on another project to dive deeper into topics like proper initialization, optimization techniques, and more. Stay tuned!
